# SharePointShortURL

In this project I am sharing instructions and sample code to help you create short links using sharepoint.

### Use case
VÃ©ronique needs to include a link to a Microsoft Teams meeting invites in the corporate HR employee learning system. The system only accepts a maximum lenght of 100 characters. The Microsoft Teams meeting invite is well above 100 characters.

### Common approach 
Users will typically use a third party like https://bitly.com/
This approach may not be appropriate as you are sending trafic outside of your organization.

### Proposed solution
Host ASPX files using the shortest path possible on your SharePoint site and use a basic HTML technique to redirect users to the longer URL.  

### Requirements
* Read/Write access to a SharePoint file repository.

### Instructions




### Versioning
