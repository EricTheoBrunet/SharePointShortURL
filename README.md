# SharePointShortURL

I am sharing instructions and sample code to help you create short links using sharepoint.

### Use case
VÃ©ronique needs to include a link to a meeting invite in the corporate HR learning system. The system only accepts a maximum length of 100 characters. The Microsoft Teams meeting invite is well above 100 characters.

### Common approach 
Users will typically use a third party like https://bitly.com/

This approach may not always be appropriate:
* Routing traffic outside of your organization.
* Cost implications

### Proposed solution
Host an ASPX file using the shortest path possible on your SharePoint site and use a basic HTML technique to redirect users to the longer URL.  

### Requirements
* Read/Write access to a SharePoint file repository.

### Instructions
1. Make a local copy of the file [short-url.aspx](https://github.com/EricTheoBrunet/SharePointShortURL/blob/main/short-url.aspx) found in this repository.
1. Open the file using a basic text editor like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac.
1. Replace both instances of *long-url* in the file with your long URL.
1. Set *redirect-delay* to 0. This is the number of seconds it will take before the redirect occurs. 
```
<html>
	<head>
		<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="redirect-delay; URL=long-url" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>If you are not redirected, <a href="long-url">click here</a>.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```
4. Rename the ASPX file to something meaningful, try to keep it as short as possible (this will impact the length of your short URL).
1. Upload the ASPX file to you SharePoint. Keep the folder structure and file name short. Example: https://corporate.sharepoint.com/sites/HR/Learning/Redirect/short-url.aspx for a grand total of 64 characters Yay!
1. Once uploaded click the file and you will be redirected to your long URL. If not, verify your code changes and make sure you only replaced the long-url portion of the code without changing any other character(s) it really matters.

Note: The file can only be edited locally on your computer so make sure you upload the latest file to SharePoint every time you make a change.

### FAQ
The page gets redirected before I am able to grab the short URL.
* Temporarily set the *redirect-delay* to lets say 30, upload the new changes, click on the file where you will now have 30 seconds to grab the short URL. Once you have it, set back *redirect-delay* to 0 (or the value of your choice) and upload your file.
